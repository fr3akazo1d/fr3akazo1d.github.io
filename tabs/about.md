My name is Fr3akazo1d!<br> I am new to the world of penetration testing.
This page is for my writeups from different rooms/boxes on HackTheBox, TryHackMe and Vulnhub.
I will try to design my writeups in a way that makes it easy to understand what needs to be done, and not to reveal everything in detail how it was done. So that a certain learning effect is created for the reader.
For me this is still a learning process and I am also thankful for feedback.<br>
